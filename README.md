# Goals
This rust library aims to provide a simple and efficient but powerful implementation of a spaced repetition algorithm

# Design

**This project is a work in progress! There is no functioning prototype yet. To see some of my current thoughts on design and such, check out the 'free_thougths' document in ./doc**
